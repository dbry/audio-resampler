// Time Domain Harmonic Compression and Expansion
//
// This library performs time domain harmonic scaling with pitch detection
// to stretch the timing of a 32-bit PCM signal (either mono or stereo) from
// 1/4 to 4 times its original length. This is done without altering any of
// the tonal characteristics.
//
// Use stereo (num_chans = 2), when both channels are from same source
// and should contain approximately similar content. For independent channels,
// prefer using multiple instances.
// see https://github.com/dbry/audio-stretch/issues/6
